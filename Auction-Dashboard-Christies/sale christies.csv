Caroline Augusta married the Emperor in 1816. Although she had no children of her own, she became the stepmother to the Emperor’s children from his previous marriages.<br><br>According to a contemporary inventory, the jewel—described as a <i>diamond plaque with pairs of pearls</i>—was bequeathed by the Princess of Salerno, who inherited it from her mother-in-law, Empress Caroline.<br>The title <i>Princess of Salerno </i>could plausibly refer to Marie Thérèse of Austria (1816–1867), daughter of Emperor Francis I and thus Caroline Augusta’s stepdaughter. In 1837, Marie Thérèse married Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, and her sister Marie Caroline of Austria married Leopold, Prince of Salerno. It is therefore possible that the jewel passed through the Austro-Neapolitan branch of the Habsburg family by way of dynastic alliance.<br><br><b>Probable Dating and Style</b><br>Given that Caroline Augusta became Empress in 1816, and the jewel was subsequently passed to her stepdaughter, the Princess of Salerno, it is likely that this piece was created between 1816 and the 1830s–1840s.<br><br>Stylistically, the jewel corresponds to the Empire or early Biedermeier period in Austria.",,,"- Overall condition: good.

The collaborative process involved many skilled artists and goldsmiths of the firm. It began with designs which, according to H.C. Bainbridge, were often executed by Carl Fabergé himself. The work was then carried out in stages: setting the precious stones, enamelling the flowers, adding the gold stalks and grasses, and finally assembling the flowers.<br><br>Fabergé's elegant creations were often placed in rock-crystal vases, carved in <i>trompe l'oeil </i>technique from a single piece of rock crystal to give the illusion of water. The shaped golden stems were delicately engraved with fine lines, and the flowers or berries were often executed in enamelled gold.<br><br>The present rare study of a violet shows the extraodinary skill of the enameller in imitating the matt surface of the flowers. Only a few other studies of violets are known. Models of single violet flowers in a vase are in the collection of the Cleveland Museum of Art (see M.
